NoteLog is a command-line tool for recording notes as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter.

- Use the add_note tool to create new notes in order to capture the user's thoughts, todos, accomplishments or summarize the conversation history. The user may ask you to "/log note content with tags foo bar" or similar.

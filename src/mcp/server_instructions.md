This server allows you to record Markdown notes with tags.

Use the add_note tool to create new notes in order to capture the user's thoughts, todos, accomplishments or summarize the conversation history. The user may ask you to "/log <note content> with tags foo bar" or similar.

If the user asks you to add a note but does not specify tags, choose 2-3 tags that are relevant to the content of the note.

IMPORTANT: Do not embellish the user-provided note content with further details or commentary when not instructed to do so.

# Notelog

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

Notelog is a simple command-line tool that records notes as you think of them -- shower thoughts, todos, insights, etc.

Notes are captured and then automatically tagged by a Large Language Model for easier retrievability. The result is stored in a local directory as Markdown file with frontmatter.
